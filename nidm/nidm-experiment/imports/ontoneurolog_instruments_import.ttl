Example: The INSTRUMENT 'Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale' (MADRS) is a diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. For each CODED VARIABLE, associated to a SCALE, the rater must decide whether the rating lies on the defined QUANTITATIVE SCALE ITEMS (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).""" .

       skos:definition """“A rating scale is a set of categories designed to elicit information about a quantitative or a qualitative attribute in the social sciences” (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org).
“Scales can focus on different aspects of mood, behavior, and functional abilities”. (Source: Lezak et al., 2004).
“The \"levels of measurement\", or scales of measure are expressions that typically refer to the theory of scale types developed by the psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens. Stevens proposed his theory in a 1946 Science article titled \"On the theory of scales of measurement\". In that article, Stevens claimed that all measurement in science was conducted using four different types of scales that he called \"nominal\", \"ordinal\", \"interval\" and \"ratio\". ... As a matter of fact, most of the scales used widely and effectively by psychologists are ordinal scales. ... Psychometricians like to theorise that psychometric tests produce interval scale measures of cognitive abilities (e.g. Lord & Novick, 1968; von Eye, 2005) but there is little prima facie evidence to suggest that such attributes are anything more than ordinal for most psychological data (Cliff, 1996; Cliff & Keats, 2003; Michell, 2008). ...  There has been, and continues to be, debate about the merits of the classifications, particularly in the cases of the nominal and ordinal classifications (Michell, 1986). Thus, while Stevens' classification is widely adopted, it is by no means universally accepted. ...  The theory of scale types is the intellectual handmaiden to Stevens' \"operational theory of measurement\", which was to become definitive within psychology and the behavioral sciences, despite Michell's characterization as its being quite at odds with Michell's understanding of measurement in the natural sciences (Michell, 1999). Essentially, the operational theory of measurement was a reaction to the conclusions of a committee established in 1932 by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to investigate the possibility of genuine scientific measurement in the psychological and behavioral sciences.” (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org). 
Example: The CODED VARIABLE of the INSTRUMENT 'Beck Depression Inventory' which measures the QUALITY  'Sadness' has for scale the following 4-item SCALE: ('I do not feel sad', 'I feel sad much of the time', 'I am sad all the time', 'I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it'). This SCALE has for minimum scale item the SCALE ITEM: 'I do not feel sad' and has for maximum scale item the SCALE ITEM: 'I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it'.""" .

The scale that is most meaningful statistically is one derived from the normal probability curved and based on the standard deviation unit. There are a variety of standard scores that are all translations of the same scale, based on the mean and the standard deviation. [...] The z-score is the basic, unelaborated standard score from which all others can be derived. The z-score represents, in standard deviation units, the amount a score deviates from the mean of the population from which the score is drawn. The mean of the normal curve is set at zero and the standard deviation unit has a value of one. Scores are stated in term of their distance from the mean as measured in standard deviation units. Scores above the mean have a positive value; those below the mean are negative. Neuropsychological test data can be handled very appropriately in a z-score format.
Elaborations of the z-score are called derived scores. Among the most widely used derived scores are T-scores, which are very popular in educational testing. The T-score has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.” (Lezak et al., 2004)""" .
