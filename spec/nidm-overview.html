            Neuroimaging research contains information about experimental design, data acquisition, analysis, and results
            that are associated with study participants. The culmination and tracking of this information provides insight
            in to normal and diseased brain states with potential for translation to clinical applications. This document
            provides an overview of the NIDASH Family of Documents that details a framework for data sharing in Human brain
            imaging.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This document provides a non-normative overview of the Neuroimaging Data Sharing (NIDASH) Family of Documents
            and a roadmap to using them. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging">Neuroimaging</a> is a research
            discipline that uses imaging technologies to observe neurobiology at all levels of analysis, from molecules to
            organ systems (i.e., the brain). The focus of these documents is currently on Human neuroimaging using Magnetic
            Resonance Imaging (MRI); however, the concepts described herein are intended to generalize beyond human brain
            imaging. The goal of NIDASH is to enable the wide publication and interchange of provenance information related
            to neuroimaging research to enable reproducible findings, which ranges from the experimental design and data
            acquisition of individual participant data to the analysis and results that produce scientific findings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The design of NIDASH stems from the need to address metadata-related barriers to data sharing [[!KEATORNI13]]
            that impact the reproducibility of scientific discoveries in neuroimaging, which is a focus of the NIDASH
            Working Group. Provenance information is a key aspect of reproducibility, and the NIDASH Family of Documents
            adopted the W3C PROV Working Group's approach to developing data sharing standards by extending the W3C PROV
            Recommendations. This approach embeds provenance as a fundamental data sharing primitive that captures the
            details of how a given dataset or analysis was produced. Summarizing, NIDASH Working Group recommends that
            the metadata for a data sharing framework should support:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>a core vocabulary of neuroimaging terms with definitions that extend PROV;</li>
            <li>a dataset descriptor the provides metadata about documents being shared;</li>
            <li>data structures to organize experiment data acquired in a neuroimaging project;</li>
            <li>data structures to model the preprocessing workflow of neuroimaging data;</li>
            <li>data structures to model the provenance of neuroimaging results.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Figure 1 shows the organization of NIDASH and how the specification documents relate to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Underlying the NI-DM Core is a conceptual data model called PROV ([[!prov-primer]], which defines a common
            vocabulary used to describe provenance. The PROV model is extended by NI-DM Core with terms that are used to
            describe neuroimaging research, and each term is designated as a PROV Entity, Activity, Agent, or attribute.
            In the next layer, NI-DM defines the Experiment Hierarchy ([[!NIDM-E]]), Preprocessing (NIDM-P), and Results
            ([[!NIDM-R]]). Each of the models in this layer provide additional constraints on PROV to define an
            arrangement of Entities, Activities, Agents, and Attributes using the NIDM-Core vocabulary and to construct
            a dataset document. The NIDM Descriptor ([[!NIDM-D]] provides a way to describe and link dataset documents
            by adding metadata about the project, principle investigator, license, as well as other important details.
